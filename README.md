# PORTFÃ“LIO

This is the latest version of my portfolio, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
The project is still a work in progress â€” features and content will be added over time.

The purpose of this portfolio is to gather my journey as a developer in one place, including projects, experiences, and experiments. ðŸš€
